# ai-prompt-app
Simple app to prompt chatgpt. 

if you really want to install this shit just install blackestwhites goopenai client.

Either use ```start.sh``` to start it or ```go run unitTest.go```

Then type ```firefox localhost:8080``` into your terminal

or just go to localhost on firefox like a normal human.

I just made this cause I wanted chatgpt to work with a webapp.

It works. Good enough for me.
